A Hello World! type homebrew for Nintendo 3DS. (any of them using homebrew launcher or alt.)

Things accompished with this sticky homebrew:
Colored Text (will upload later)

Things need fixing:
I got a SoundExample3DS bin (https://github.com/clank201/SoundExample3DS) and it won't 3dslink to me.
I'll try to make some sounds...

# UPDATE
I GOT THE SOUND WORKING ON THE BROKEN BUILD! I NEED TO EDIT THE BIN SO YOU KNOW IT WORKS :OOOOOOO
